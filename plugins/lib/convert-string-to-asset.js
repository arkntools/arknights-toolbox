/**
 * In webpack jargon: a compilation object represents a build of versioned
 * `assets`. The `compilation.assets` property of a compilation is a map of
 * filepaths -> asset objects. Each asset object has a property `source()` that
 * returns a string of that asset.
 *
 * `source` and `size` are the only required properties of a webpack asset.
 *
 * @typedef {Object} WebpackAsset
 *
 * @property {Function} source Returns a string representation of the asset that
 *           will be written to the file system (or generated in-memory) by
 *           webpack.
 * @property {Function} size Returns the byte size of the asset `source` value.
